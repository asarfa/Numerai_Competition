In the rapidly evolving financial landscape, the deployment of data-driven approaches to portfolio management has become increasingly critical. Founded in 2015, Numerai is a blockchain-powered, AI-driven hedge fund focused on improving stock market inefficiencies by aggregating thousands of crowdsourced machine learning models to predict the stock market. Leveraging the collective intelligence of data scientists around the world while with "obfuscated" financial data, the best submissions are ensembled into a meta model which is used to trade the stock market. The Numerai hedge fund consists of equally weighted long and short portfolios with approximately 500 individual equities in each portfolio, resulting in a long/short portfolio with a beta close to zero. 
This paper explains the research process that led to participation in the Numerai tournament. Utilizing a a cross-sectional strategy, a well-adapted context-aware neural network model is leveraged to generate systematic ranking signals. As the field of systematic investments continues to evolve, this research offers a comprehensive blueprint for integrating modern deep learning tools in the investment process to generate alpha.
